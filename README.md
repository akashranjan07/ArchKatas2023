## Architecture Characteristic
The RoadWarriers App is designed to be a centralized dashboard for all the trips/bookings made by the traveller for air,train,car rental and Hotel bookings by interacting with various preferred travel agencies

The UI needs to be interactive and Rich and responsiveness on web and mobile device is high

The number of users per day 2M Weekly avergaing to approx 300k DAU and can go upto 15M at peak times like seasonal holidays,school vacations etc.Scale and Elasticity therefore are important to be factored into the design

(1) Availability - The platform must allow users to connect with each other at any time of day or night as the app is international. And 5 mins per month ~60 mins Annual downtime will needa highly available system of 99.99%.[Note :Not all services are critical and some microservices can be 99.9% available]

(2) Responsiveness - The platform must handle requests quickly enough load the web portal within 800 ms and mobile under 1 sec.

(3) Interoperability : Since the system interfaces with various airlines globally,rail networks,car rentals and social media API's,interoperability with systems that are both legacy and distributed with platform agnosticity needs to be built.

(4) Scalability and Elasticity based on the Weekly user activity numbers given and also if the portal becomes popular,international demand needs to be supported.

(5) Evolvability-Both the UI and interfaces need to be deisgned for future extendability and to support growth of the platform in the form of new regions/vendors/travel agencies onboarded.


## Dashboard Presentation:

Develop a user-friendly dashboard where users can view their trips.

Provide options to edit, delete, or add new bookings to the trip.

## User Preferences:

Allow users to set preferences for how they want their trips grouped or presented on the dashboard.

## Data Extractor

Extract relevant details from the identified emails, including:
Flight details (e.g., airline, flight number, departure, arrival, date, time).
Rail details (e.g., train name, departure, arrival, date, time).
Car rental details (e.g., rental agency, pickup, return location, date, time).

**Data Storage**
Store the extracted travel booking data in a database. You may need separate tables for different types of bookings (air, rail, car).

**Trip Grouping**
Implement a trip grouping algorithm that identifies bookings belonging to the same trip based on shared criteria (e.g., common dates, destinations).
Group the bookings into trips and create a trip identifier.

Display each trip with a summary of the bookings (flights, trains, car rentals) and relevant details (dates, times, destinations).



## Notifications and Alerts:

Implement notifications/alerts to inform users when new bookings are detected or when trip details are updated.

## CAP

Availability of the platform to a large degree and critical functions like Trip detail viewing/Airline Gate changes or updates cannot be missed by any traveller
Consistency of user experience on both web and mobile platforms as well as consistency of the data writes/reads is important

## Capacity Planning
Cloud Infra from AWS/Azure/GCP planner.
